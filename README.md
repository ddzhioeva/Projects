    <td>We have conducted a marketing research project to determine a good plan for a telecom company. Through preliminary analysis of a sample of customers, we discovered that many of them were using archived rates.</td>
    <td>Python, Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data preprocessing, math, machine learning</td>

    <td> We have been provided data on customers' behavior who have already switched to mobile tariffs. It would be best if we built a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate rate. Data preprocessing is not required - the data is already preprocessed. It is crucial to achieve an accuracy of at least 0.75.</td>

    <td> The client is the Credit department of the bank. The tasks consist of recognizing whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The study's results will be considered when building a credit scoring model - a particular system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank. </td>

    <td> Research analysis and data preprocessing for a dataset with advertisements for selling apartments in St. Petersburg have been carried out. The influence of the area, ceilings, the number of rooms, and the date of announcement on the prices of apartments in all the presented settlements and the center of St. Petersburg for constructing an automated system for determining costs to avoid fraud and anomalies were revealed.  </td>
